# DeepPainterlyHarmonization
Our final project of the Tensorflow lecture. This is the first known to us implementation of [Deep Painterly Harmonization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03189) in Tensorflow 2. Deep Painterly Harmonization adjust the stlye of an image onto a sticker. ![blub](https://github.com/drduda/DeepPainterlyHarmonization/blob/master/images/detailed_graphics.png)
