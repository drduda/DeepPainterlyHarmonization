# Deep Painterly Harmonization
This is the first implementation of [Deep Painterly Harmonization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03189) in Tensorflow 2. [Our version](https://github.com/drduda/DeepPainterlyHarmonization/blob/master/Model_of_Deep_Painterly_Harmonization.ipynb) is optimized for running with Google Colab. Just click *Run everything* to explore it interactively!
